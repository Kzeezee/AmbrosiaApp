## Introduction
 Ambrosia is an Android calories tracker app providing users with an easy-to-use, food tracking and recording mobile application to monitor its users' food intake. It aims to simplify the often long and annoying process of monitoring nutritional intake by allowing users to quickly add it to the user's records either through QR code scanning or manual recording. 
 
 Ambrosia is built with the side functionality of allowing food vendors, particularly those who cater towards healthy eating, to take advantage of the QR code scanning feature. Vendors can create their Ambrosia vendor accounts and register their restaurants and food items' nutritional information in Ambrosia. The food items will then have a QR code that Ambrosia users can quickly scan and add it to their nutritional records. 
 
 Ambrosia utilises Google's Firebase to handle authentication and Firestore to hold user's nutritional intake history. This app was developed for a project assignment that I had as a student.
